<p>I am a budding IT specialist with a background in business and architecture. I believe my past knowledge and
    experience will bring a fresh perspective to the IT industry.</p>

<p>I am studying a Higher Diploma in Computing in the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) to fully develop
my knowledge of computer science. I already have had extensive experience of working with 
computers, most notably Photoshop, CAD, sketch-up, In-design and other design orientated software.</p>

<p>In 2004 I enrolled on a degree course in Architectural Technology in DIT, graduating in 2007
with a 2.1 Award. I began working in the National Building Agency in summer 2007 and I left that
company to continue my Architectural education in 2009. In 2009 I enrolled in the University College Dublin
(UCD) Architecture programme. Graduating in 2012 with a 2.1 Degree award, I became a PA/Architectural Adviser to a
restaurateur during the day, enrolling in a Certificate in Business Operations in Dublin Business School in the evening.</p>

<p>In March 2013 I began my career in ICT. Computer Science, especially software design and programming, is
a very interesting field to be involved in. My subjects include Object-Orientated software Design, Web and 
User Interface Design, Systems Analysis and Testing and Information Systems. I will 
choose to specialise in Software Development or Data Analytics towards the end of the course.</p>
